__PLEASE DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY.__

Hello, we're excited to have your interest in ConsenSys Diligence, and we appreciate you taking the time to complete our take home challenge.

## Instructions

In this repository you'll find a contract name `HackableToken.sol`. This is an ERC20 contract, with a totalSupply of tokens based on ETH deposits. A deposit of 1 ETH, get's 1 token. There is an issue with this token, which makes it possible for an attacker to withdraw more than they have deposited!

To complete the challenge:

1. Write the `Attacker.sol` contract
2. Complete the second test in `test/attack.js`, so that all tests pass.
2. Complete the content in `Vulnerability.md`, according to the headings and comments in that file.

Once complete, send us a zip file containing this repository with your additions.

### Tips

* Use `npm run ganache` to run a local blockchain. (Ganache is the new name for testrpc)
* You may find it helpful to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for writing the contracts.
 
There's no deadline on this. 

It's quite possible there's some detail missing from this description. 

**Please let us know if you have any questions.**
